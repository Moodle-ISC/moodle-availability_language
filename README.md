moodle-availability_language
======================================

Restrict module and section access based on user language.

Language filters are great, but sometimes they can make your resources and activities very complex. 
This availability condition makes it easy to show an English resource only to English users and an
activity in French only to French speaking students.

WARNING: The Moodle Mobile app relies on the user profile language and/or course language to show or hide a resource: the language selected in the app does NOT prevail.

Check the global documentation about conditional availability conditions : https://docs.moodle.org/en/Conditional_activities_settings

Installation:

1. Unpack the zip file into the availability/condition/ directory. A new directory will be created called language.
2. Go to Site administration > Notifications to complete the plugin installation.
